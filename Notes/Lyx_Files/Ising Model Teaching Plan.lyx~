\noindent
The plan of this design is to cover a 75-minute class on the Ising model,
 and we plan to cover fundamental concepts, examples, and encouraging interactiv
e discussions.
 The following is an skeleton of the class, we're still working on the actual
 notes for the class nd also the

Goals (Primary Ideas)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
Get the Basics of the Ising Model: By the end of the class, you should understan
d what the Ising model is all aboutâ€”how it represents spins on a grid, the
 interactions between them, and why it's a big deal in statistical mechanics.
 You'll see how it helps us study phase transitions and critical behavior
 in materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
Learn to Solve Ising-like Problems: We want to provide our classmates with
 the skills to tackle simple problems related to the Ising model.
 This means using formulas like Hamiltonians and partition functions to
 figure out stuff like magnetization and critical temperatures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
Think Critically about the Model and Possible Generalizations: Finally,
 we want to provide our classmates with an overview or the things that we
 can study with the Ising Model or Spin Systems, i.e., some generalizations
 and cool stuff that people are doing in the research community.

Outline of the topics and class Structure:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
Introduction to Statistical Mechanics 
\series bold
(10 minutes, Zahra & Emmanuel)
\series default
: Briefly review the principles of statistical mechanics relevant to the
 Ising model, we want to present useful results and set some notation in
 for the rest of the class.
 We want to discuss the importance of models in understanding physical systems,
 with an special emphasis on the fact that the model is designed to capture
 some specific phenomena (ferromagnetism) and sometimes a full description
 of the system under study is not possible, at least not with just one framework.
 - Introduce the Ising model as a key model in statistical mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
Here we want to start with a nice 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

warm-up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and ask questions such as:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
Please write the definition of the partition function, and write some thermodyna
mical quantities that you can derive knowing that function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
Then we want to give them around 3 minutes to write something on the importante
 of the partition function in statistical mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
With this in mind we're going to proceed with the discussion.

 way.

Two-Dimensional Ising Model for Non-interacting spins 
\series bold
(20 minutes, Zahra)
\series default
: Instead of focusing on the 1D version and then switch to the 2D version
 we decide to focus from the start on the 2D version, but first we want
 to start with non-interacting spins because it leads to a very nice solution.

 say the class that now, they're ready to solve the full problem and give
 them 2-3 minutes to give it a try.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
We decided to start this way because this will make our classmates start
 thinking in the difficulties when working with the intercting spins.
 Rather than say: oh look this is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

difficult
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we want to first them try and see if they can find where is the

We want to quickly talk about universality classes and say that the Ising

 We know that this topic quite advanced but we are going to present it to
 the class in very easy terms.

Teaching Methodology:

\begin_layout Itemize

After your great suggestions we dedided to include several activities during
 the class, such as easy derivations.
 And during some of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

live
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 derivations we want to ask question as: "ok, what could be the next step?",
 and what's the interpretation of the computed results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
We plan to use some diagrams which think are going to help understant the
 computed results: we plan to emphasize that sometimes it's quite helfun
 to know how to explore computationaly some systems, that could lead you
 to a better understaning of the phenomena.
