\title{Notes on Finite Element Method}
\author{Emmanuel Flores}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
Any finite element algorithm has essentially four ingredients
\begin{itemize}
\item Variational formulation in an inifite-dimensional space
\item Variational formulation in a finite-dimensional space
\item Construction of a basis in the finite-dimensional space
\item Assembly ans solution of the resulting linear system
\end{itemize}
The main idea is to lift or relax the assumptions made in a regular PDE problem, this is: usually the resctrictions are too

The support of a function is the set of points in which the function is non-zero.
