abstract = {A two-dimensional finite-difference technique for irregular meshes is formulated for derivatives up to the second order. The domain in the vicinity of a given central point is broken into eight 45 degree pie shaped segments and the closest finite-difference point in each segment to the center point is noted. By utilizing Taylor series expansions about a central point with a unique averaging process for the points in the four diagonal segments, good approximations to all derivatives up to the second order and including the mixed derivatives are obtained. For square meshes the general derivative expressions for arbitrary meshes which were determined reduce to the usual finite difference formulae. In one example problem the Poisson equation is solved for an irregular mesh. In a second example for the first time a problem with a geometric nonlinearity, namely large deflection response of a flat membrane, is solved with an irregular mesh. The solutions compare very favorably with results obtained previously. Some discussion is given on possible approaches for determination of finite difference derivatives higher than the second.}

abstract = {This study was dedicated to develop an improved version of meshless generalized finite difference method (GFDM) which benefits from various aspects: Present method, uses stars (group of nodes around a central node) with only six nodes for calculating derivatives; it is not dependent on weighting functions and it is not based on moving least square (MLS) methods. Developing the method, the approximation schemes were suggested for estimating first and second partial derivatives along with the Laplacian term. Moreover, three sources for singularity of coefficient matrix were found and the remedies were suggested to avoid them. All these aspects made the method as a stable and consistent one. Implementing various boundary conditions was also explained where a clever technique was proposed to implement Neumann boundary condition in its exact form. The order of accuracy of the method was obtained theoretically and confirmed by the numerical tests. The applicability of the method was approved through its excellent results obtained for the heat conduction problem in two geometries. Clearly, the present method has improved efficiency while its general applications are the same as other GFDMs.}
