In 1837, Faraday made an experiment to demonstrate that even if electric
 charges do not flow through insulators, they nevertheless have an impact
 on electrostatic phenomena.

\begin_deeper

Describe this experiment and the results Faraday obtained?
\end_layout

\noindent
Faraday used an insulated container, known as an ice pail, made of a non-conduct
ive material like glass or resin.
 The ice pail was suspended from a silk thread to ensure that it was electricall
y isolated from its surroundings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First, he charged the ice pail: we can charge the ice pail by bringing a
 charged object (like a glass rod rubbed with silk) close to it.
 The presence of the charged object induced a charge on the surface of the
 ice pail, even though it was an insulator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then, we observe the following: despite being an insulator, the charged
 ice pail exhibited electrostatic effects.
 For examples, Faraday noticed that small pieces of paper or other lightweight
 objects would be attracted to the charged surface of the ice pail, demonstratin
g that electrostatic forces were at play.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
And finnaly, there's no flow of electric charge: Faraday observed that there
 was no flow of electric charge through the insulating material of the ice
 pail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color blue
Ans: He compared the amount of electricity stored in Leyden bottles having
 different materials between the two conductors.
 He found that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\text{air}}<C_{\text{glass}}<C_{\text{sulfur}}$
\end_inset

.
 The nature of the dielectric therefore impacts the amount of charges that
 can be accumulated on each conductor and the potential difference between
 the conductors.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

Explain how he argued that these results must be interpreted as an induced
 polarization inside the insulator.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
But, Faraday knew that the capacity

 increases as the distance between conductor gets reduced, therefore, if
 we add more insulators this is equivalent of bringing plates closer, i.e.
 bring opposite charges closer.
 But insulators are made of particles with a positive and a negative ends,
 then the electric field in the capacitor induces a polarization of these
 particles in a way that increases the capacitance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color blue
Ans: Faraday knew that in the air, the capacitance increases when the distance
 between the conducting plates decreased.
 Adding insulators is equivalent to bringing the plates closer.
 The resulting increase in capacitance means a reduction of potential difference
 between the capacitor plates, which is equivalent to an effective reduction
 of charges in the vicinity of each plate.
 Since no charges are transferred from one plate to another, it means that
 some charges get induced in the insulator close to the capacitor plates
 with opposite sign.
 Faraday concluded that the electric field induced a redistribution of charges
 inside the insulator in a way to oppose to the external

-field.

Faraday’s explanation of dielectric electrostatic effects served as the
 basis for the semi-classical model of polarization as atomic stretches
 and molecular rotations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\noindent
What is the difference between the strong and the weak polarization modeling?
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
First of all, let's recall what does it mean to model polarization in terms
 of stretches and molecular rotations.
 For example, if we have an atom, we know that in the nuclei we have a positive
 charge whereas in the surroundings we have an electron cloud, then, if
 we apply an external electromagnetic field, we have the effect of a net
 dipole in the atom, and if we think in the atom as a sphere, this external
 field will have the effect of deform this sphere into a paraboloid.
 On the other hand, some molecules have a permanent dipole moment, therefore,
 if a uniform external field is applied, then no induced there will not
 be an indudec polarization, because the material is already polarized,
 however, there will be torque which will be applied on small permanent
 dipole elements.
 In the first model because the electron cloud is stretching we refer as
 the mdoel of atomic stretches, and on the other, because we have a net
 torque, we can refer to them as molecular rotartions.
 Now, let's move on to the pro and cons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
On one hand, weak with the weak polarization model we are tyring to figure
 it out what are the observable quantities that can affect the experimental
 measurement of polarization to be used in further predictions, and we can
 say that we're not deriving the theory from first princeples, instead,
 we're using a phenomenological approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
On the other hand, with the strong polarization model, we're trying to provide
 an empirically adequate description of polarization phenomena using a more
 fundamental (non-effective) theory, in some sense, we're trying to derive
 this phenomena from first principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color blue
Ans: The strong version of the semi-classical model of polarization consists
 in claiming that it provides an empirically adequate description of the
 polarization phenomena, up to some level of averaging approximation, that
 occurs at the microscopic scale, and that this more fundamental theory
 can be used to make adequate predictions for the relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{𝑃}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{𝐸}$
\end_inset

.
 (i.e.
 to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

).
 The weak version consists in assuming that this model does not claim to
 provide a proper description of the polarization reality, but is nevertheless
 a useful tool to determine which observable quantities can be used to control
 polarization or to produce special relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{𝑃}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{𝐸}$
\end_inset

, the details of which will be measured in dedicated experiments (i.e.
 to provide a strategy to measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
What are the pros and cons of such modeling of polarization?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\noindent
At the end, we're interested in making measurements of macroscopial phenoma,
 at least at this level in the theory, so as long as the theory at hand
 give us the correct prediction we should stick with it, this approach could
 see very pracmatic, and indeed, it is, however when working on aby theory
 we should always try to keep this in mind: the theory is valid or useful
 withing a some range, could be a time scale, space scale, or another combinatio
n.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
With this in mind, we can say that the Fraday's approach in good in the
 sense that it allow us to build a good model/understanding of macroscopic
 behavior of electrostatic field in dielectrics, which will also allow us
 to gain some insight with the phenomena at hand.
 And moreover, many macroscopic electrostatic systems will be described
 in the exact same way as the electrons in E-field of our semi-classical
 approach, thus, we can map this model into more sophisticated theories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\paragraph_spacing onehalf
\noindent
On the other hand, this is an effective theory, which means that is only
 valid at a large scale (mesoscopic), and is really important, as I said
 earlier, we should always try to keep in mind the range of validity/aplicabilit
y of our theory.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\noindent
An even more, because it's a phenomenological theory, this implies that
 there are some numerical values, or parameter that should be given to the
 theory in order to make it work, and another way of say it is that this
 parameters cannot be derived from first principles using this thory.
