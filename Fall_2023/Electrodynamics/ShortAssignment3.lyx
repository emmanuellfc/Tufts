\begin_layout Enumerate
Why is it important to introduce the concept of potential energy in electromagne
tism? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Energy is one of the fundamental concepts in physics.
 From a classical mechanics perspective, when you know that the energy is
 conserved in one system, you can immediately deduce useful information
 for the dynamical equations of motion.
 Even more, it's a concept that's present in classical physics and also
 in modern physics, such as relativistic theories or quantum theories.
 Moreover, when we start talking about energy, it almost immediately brings
 to mind the theory of thermodynamics, and it turns out that for analyzing
 electric phenomena from a thermodynamic or statistical perspective, the
 concept of electric energy plays a major role in that.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The concept of electric potential energy can be defined by an empirical
 procedure that connects mechanical energies to the effect of an electric
 field and charges on a mechanical system.
 What is this procedure? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This procedure essentially can be described as follows, let's consider the
 work done in order to build a stable charge configuration, but let's do
 that in the following way, let's suppose we bring one charge from infinity,
 and because there’s no charge or field to fight against, the work will
 be the line integral of the electric potential.
 And now we repeat that process over and over again, but now we must add
 the effect of the other charges present in the distribution.
 In this way, we can define electrical energy from a mechanical perspective.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
In addition to the above procedure, there is a fundamental formal (in the
 sense of mathematics) assumption about potential energies that must also
 be made to bring the concept of potential energy into electrostatics.
 What is this assumption? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
In classical mechanics, when we have a conservative system, i.e., a system
 in which we know the energy is conserved, we can obtain the force as the
 derivative (in one dimension) or the gradient (when dealing with more than
 one dimension) of some scalar function, called the potential function.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the above procedure and assumption, demonstrate that the fully internalize
d concept of potential energy satisfies Δ𝑈e=𝑄Δ𝑉, which is fully expressed
 in terms of quantities defined in electrostatics.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Again, by definition, the total electrostatic energy 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is defined as the total work requiered to assemble a charge distribution
 from an initial condiguration in which all the charges are at inifity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\noindent
Therefore, for the charge one, because there is no field to fight against,
 and this implies that there is no work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the second charge, this has to fight for the field due to the first
 charge, which is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W_{12}=q_{2}\left(\phi_{1}\left(\mathbf{r}_{2}\right)-\phi_{1}\left(\infty\right)\right)=q_{2}\Delta\phi_{1},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies W_{12}=q_{2}\phi_{1}\left(\mathbf{r}_{2}\right),
\]

\end_inset

because the work for bringing the charge from infity to that point it's
 zero, and on the other hand, we can also write explicitly the potential,
 thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W_{12}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{2}q_{1}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\right|},
\]

\end_inset

and now, if we sum over all the particles in the distribution, we have that
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{E}=W=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\sum_{i}\sum_{i>j}\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies U_{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\sum_{i}\sum_{i>j}\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|}
\]

\end_inset

and the condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $i>j$
\end_inset

 comes from the fact that the carges does not interact with themselves,
 but we can also arrange the previous equation in the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{E}=\frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}}\sum_{i}\sum_{i\neq j}\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{\left|\mathbf{r}_{i}-\mathbf{r}_{j}\right|}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}q_{i}\phi\left(\mathbf{r}_{i}\right)=Q\Delta\phi,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore U_{E}=\frac{1}{2}Q\Delta\phi.
\]

\end_inset
