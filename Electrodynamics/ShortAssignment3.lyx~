Why is it important to introduce the concept of potential energy in electromagne
tism? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Energy is one of the fundamental concepts in physics.
 From a classical mechanics perspective, when you know that the energy is
 conserved in one system, you can immediately deduce useful information
 for the dynamical equations of motion.
 Even more, it's a concept that's present in classical physics and also
 in modern physics, such as relativistic theories or quantum theories.
 Moreover, when we start talking about energy, it almost immediately brings
 to mind the theory of thermodynamics, and it turns out that for analyzing
 electric phenomena from a thermodynamic or statistical perspective, the
 concept of electric energy plays a major role in that.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The concept of electric potential energy can be defined by an empirical
 procedure that connects mechanical energies to the effect of an electric
 field and charges on a mechanical system.
 What is this procedure? 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This procedure essentially can be described as follows, let's consider the
 work done in order to build a stable charge configuration, but let's do
 that in the following way, let's suppose we bring one charge from infinity,
 and because there‚Äôs no charge or field to fight against, the work will
 be the line integral of the electric potential.
 And now we repeat that process over and over again, but now we must add
 the effect of the other charges present in the distribution.
 In this way, we can define electrical energy from a mechanical perspective.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
In addition to the above procedure, there is a fundamental formal (in the
 sense of mathematics) assumption about potential energies that must also
 be made to bring the concept of potential energy into electrostatics.
 What is this assumption? In classical mechanics, when we have a conservative
 system, i.e., a system in which we know the energy is conserved, we can obtain
 the force as the derivative (in one dimension) or the gradient (when dealing
 with more than one dimension) of some scalar function, called the potential
 function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the above procedure and assumption, demonstrate that the fully internalize
d concept of potential energy satisfies Œîùëàe=ùëÑŒîùëâ, which is fully expressed
 in terms of quantities defined in electrostatics.
