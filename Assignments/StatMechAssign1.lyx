\begin_layout Standard
The figure shows the P-V diagram for an unlikely, but conceivable, cyclic
 process involving two isothermal steps (in blue) and two steps in which
 pressure varies linearly with volume (in red).
 Assume that the working medium is a fixed quantity of a monatomic ideal
 gas, and, of course, that all steps are quasi-static and that they proceed
 clockwise.

 In each case, clearly state whether the gas is doing work or having work
 done on it, and whether the gas is receiving or releasing heat, and explain
 why that makes sense physically as well as mathematically.

 Which of your values would be different if the gas were diatomic instead

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) Before any calculations, I want to make one assumption, in what follows,
 I'll be using the first law in the following form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta U=Q-W,
\]

\end_inset

which corresponds to the Clausius convention or interpretation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, for an ideal gas it is true that 
\begin_inset Formula $pV=nRT$
\end_inset

.
 For this cyclic process, we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is fixed, and furthermore 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is constant.
 So let's put our attention on the isothermal processes and of these let's
 focus on the process with the highest temperature.
 Now, because those processes are done at a fixed temperature, in virtue
 of the ideal gas equation, we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $nRT$
\end_inset

 will be a constant, thus we can obtain the functional relationship of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 as follows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
pV=nRT=\alpha\implies p=\frac{\alpha}{V},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is just a constant, as stated previously.
 Now, with this information, we can calculate the work, which is given by
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}pdV\implies W=\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}\frac{\alpha}{V}dV=\alpha\ln\left(\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}}\right),
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies W=\alpha\ln\left(\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

in this case, the numerical values for the volumes are 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}=4$
\end_inset

, then, the work is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=\alpha\ln\left(\frac{2}{4}\right)=\alpha\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right),
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies W=\alpha\ln\left(\frac{2}{4}\right)=\alpha\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=-0.693\alpha,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore W_{1}=-0.693\alpha,
\]

\end_inset

and moreover, for ideal gases, we know that the internal energy is a function
 that depends just on the temperature, that is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=U\left(T\right),
\]

\end_inset

and this relationship is linear, this is 
\begin_inset Formula $U=nRT$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $nR$
\end_inset

 in this case is just a constant, thus, for an ideal gas and an isothermal
 process the change in internal energy is zero, thus in virtue of the first
 law, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{1}=W_{1}.
\]

\end_inset

Now, for the other isothermal process, the procedure and the calculation
 is the same, the only difference is in the volume initial and final, which
 in this case are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}=6$
\end_inset

, thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=\alpha\ln\left(\frac{6}{1}\right)=\alpha\ln\left(6\right),
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies W_{2}=1.792\alpha,
\]

\end_inset

and again, in virtue of the first law, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{2}=W_{2}.
\]

\end_inset

Now, let's move on with the linear process: again, we need a functional
 relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, but because the process is linear, we can calculate the slope of the line
 and the intersection with the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-axis, that is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta v}=\frac{1-9}{6-4}=-\frac{8}{2}-4\implies p=-4V+b,
\]

\end_inset

but because we know that the point 
\begin_inset Formula $(4,9)$
\end_inset

 is an element of the line, we can determine the 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 constant by direct evaluation, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
9=-4(4)+b\implies b=25,
\]

\end_inset

and thus, the functional relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p=-4V+25,
\]

\end_inset

and with this, we can compute the work as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}pdV=\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}\left(-4V+25\right)dV=-4\frac{V^{2}}{2}|_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}+25V|_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies W=-2\left(V_{f}^{2}-V_{i}^{2}\right)+25(V_{f}-V_{i}),
\]

\end_inset

in this case is important to notice that the slope 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 has dimensions, otherwise our equation will be wrong, and the volumes for
 this part of the cycle are 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}=6$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}=4$
\end_inset

, then, the work is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=W=-2\left(6^{2}-4^{2}\right)+25(6-4),
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies W=-2(20)+25(2)=10,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore W_{3}=10.
\]

\end_inset

Now, for the heat, the approach is to calculate the change in internal energy
 and from that, use the first law to calculate the heat.
 Indeed, using the equation for the internal energy of an ideal gas, we
 have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\alpha T\implies\Delta U=\alpha\Delta T,
\]

\end_inset

and the temperature can be calculated for each one of the isotherms using
 the ideal gas equation, thus, in general we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
pV=\alpha T\implies T=\frac{pV}{\alpha},
\]

\end_inset

and for the first isotherm, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T=\frac{36}{\alpha},
\]

\end_inset

whereas for the second isotherm
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T=\frac{6}{\alpha},
\]

\end_inset

thus, the change in internal energy is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta U=\alpha\Delta T=\alpha\left(\frac{6}{\alpha}-\frac{36}{\alpha}\right)=-30
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\Delta U=-30,
\]

\end_inset

and with this at hand, in virtue of the first law, the heat is given by
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q=\Delta U+W,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies Q=-30+10=-20,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore Q=-20.
\]

\end_inset

And again, for the other linear process, we proceed in the same way: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m=\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta v}=\frac{18-6}{2-1}=\frac{12}{1}=12\implies p=12V+b,
\]

\end_inset

but because we know that the point 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,6)$
\end_inset

 is an element of the line, we can determine the 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 constant by direct evaluation, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
6=12(1)+b\implies b=-6,
\]

\end_inset

and thus, the functional relation between 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p=12V-6,
\]

\end_inset

and with this in mind we can also calculate the work.
 Indeed,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}pdV=\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}\left(12V-6\right)dV=12\frac{V^{2}}{2}|_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}-6V|_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies W=6\left(V_{f}^{2}-V_{i}^{2}\right)-6(V_{f}-V_{i}),
\]

\end_inset

now, in this case the volumes are given by 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}=1$
\end_inset

, then, the work is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=6\left(4-1\right)-6(2-1)=12,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies W=12,
\]

\end_inset

and again, using the same procedure as for the other linear process, we
 can calculate the change in temperature, and from that the change in internal
 energy, and with that, the heat:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta U=\alpha\Delta T=\alpha\left(\frac{36}{\alpha}-\frac{6}{\alpha}\right)=30,
\]

\end_inset

thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q=\Delta U+W,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies Q=30+12=42,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore Q=42.
\]

\end_inset

There are some issues with the development of my solution.
 Here I will like to elaborate a little more on that:

 of the problem, in particular for the 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{on,1}$
\end_inset

 on the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int dV/V$
\end_inset

, from given figure the integration limits should be 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}=4$
\end_inset

 and the

, not sure if I'm misreading the plot, and the same applies for 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{on,2}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Itemize
Because I used a different convention, it makes sense that the work changes
 sign, but overall, I think that the physics is well interpreted.

 You are not expected to produce quantitatively accurate results, and the

\begin_layout Standard
In the following discussion I'm assuming that the pressure is fixed.
 Now, an increase in the temperature of some system usually also increases
 the volume liquids and solids.
 In this case we're interested in a volumetric expansion, but we can first
 think of a linear expansion, and in this case it has been seen experimentally
 that, if the change in the temperature is not very large (around 100 C°),
 then the increase in volume is proportional to the temperature change,
 and this proportionality is, to a very good approximation, linear, and
 follows the equation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta V=\beta V_{0}\Delta T,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the volume expansion coefficient.
 On the other hand as (bad) first approximation, maybe we could think of
 this problem as an ideal gas, in which, by the ideal gas law, we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
pV=nRT,
\]

\end_inset

and if we fix the pressure, then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=\frac{nR}{p}T,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies V=\alpha_{1}T,
\]

\end_inset

which gives us also a linear dependence, however, as I argued before this
 is valid if the change in the temperature is not very large, but still,
 it could be us a picture in mind of what's happening in the system.

First, I totally agree with your graph, and I understand what you're trying
 to say.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
However, the main issue here is that I considered the volume of the water
 and the volume of the gas as two different things.
 In my mind I was thinking that above at 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

 degrees Celsius water evaporates, which means that the volume of water
 is less.
 However in the problem you stated to draw the diagram for the whole system,
 and I misread that.

which gives us also a linear dependence, however, I think that after the
 water evaporates, because we just have gas, I think the pressure is more
 easy to increment, that's why I don't expect a linear behavior beyond 100
 C°.

I found really interesting all the discussion you made in order to justify
 the drop in the pressure, while true (it seems to me) I find really hard

However, I think we agree on the behavior after that drop in the pressure.

(Problem 5)

 Classically, a diatomic molecule has three degrees of freedom associated
 with center-of- mass motion, two degrees of freedom associated with rotational
 motion around axes perpendicular to the interatomic bond, one degree of
 freedom associated with rotational motion around the interatomic bond (see
 the figure), and two degrees of freedom (KE and PE) associated with the
 interatomic vibration.
 That’s 8 degrees of freedom.
 So the equipartition theorem says that the average internal energy per
 molecule should be 
\begin_inset Formula $4k_{B}T$
\end_inset

, but in fact, for normal conditions, it’s 
\begin_inset Formula $(5/2)k_{B}T$

 For a nitrogen molecule, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

, estimate the moment of inertia 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 for rotation about axes perpendicular and parallel to the molecular axis,
 that is, the line joining the nuclei.
 Remember that virtually all of the mass is contained in the nuclei, which
 have radii 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim10-15$
\end_inset

 m, but there is also an electron cloud, which has much less mass, but a
 much larger radius.
 You don’t need to do any complicated calculations with the parallel axis
 theorem; we’re just trying to get the right order of magnitude.

 Quantum mechanically, we know that the angular momentum is quantized.
 Using this fact, estimate, in eV, the spacing between rotational energy
 levels, for rotations perpendicular and parallel to the molecular axis.
 (The levels are not evenly spaced, but we’re just looking for the order
 of magnitude, for relatively small 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

).

 The vibrational frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{2}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2560\text{cm}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 (In infrared spectroscopy, frequencies are usually given in units of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{cm}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 What this really means is that 1 1 2560cm λ − = where λ is the wavelength
 of light at that frequency.) To a very good approximation, we can model
 the vibration as a harmonic oscillator.
 What is the spacing of energy levels, in eV?

 Classical thermodynamics generally works as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T$
\end_inset

 is much greater than the energy spacing between quantum mechanical energy
 levels.
 Using this insight, explain which degrees of freedom can be described classical
ly, and, thus, why the average energy is 
\begin_inset Formula $(5/2)k_{B}T$
\end_inset

 at temperatures not too far from room temperature.

\series default
 Room temperature is around 20 C° which is to a good approximation 293 K,
 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}=1.381\times10^{-23}\text{J/K}$
\end_inset

, and we have the following conversion 
\begin_inset Formula $1ev=1.602\times10^{-19}J$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{B}T=293\times1.381\times10^{-23}\times\frac{1\text{ev}}{1.602\times10^{-19}}[K]\left[\frac{J}{K}\right]\left[\frac{ev}{J}\right],
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore k_{B}T=0.025ev.
\]

 What is something specific you understand better than you did before? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think it is important to take into account the limitations of the models
 I am working with, that is, knowing their conditions of applicability.
 I believe the problems served as a reminder of the topics I covered and
 learned in undergrad.

 What is something specific that surprised, confused, or intrigued you,
 or that you struggled with?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conventions have always been difficult for me, or the point of reference,
 whether the heat is positive or negative, for me it is clear that the work
 is the integral under the curve, but even so, every time I solve an exercise
 I tend to review the book and the notation it uses, just to know exactly
 what your reference point is like.

 What is something that this problem set made you want to know more about?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to my lack of organization I was not able to finish the last exercise,
 but I would like to explore more.
 The area in which I have the most experience is doing molecular dynamics,
 and I am curious how I could model that specific system.
 Honestly, I would like to explore this a little more.
