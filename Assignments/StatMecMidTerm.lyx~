\begin_layout Problem
Let’s go back to the cyclical heat engine we’ve analyzed in the last two
 assignments.
 In this problem we’re going to work out the Clausius integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T}$
\end_inset

.
 We already know from HW #2 how to evaluate the contributions from the isotherma
l legs.
 It remains to deal with the linear ones.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
As the system moves along the path, P,V, and T all change.
 Show that, for a monatomic ideal gas:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\frac{\delta Q}{T}=\frac{3}{2}nRf\left(p_{A},p_{B}\right)+\frac{5}{2}nRf\left(V_{A},V_{B}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and specify the form of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a,b)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using this result, calculate the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T}$
\end_inset

 for the entire cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What does your result imply regarding the reversibility of the cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compare your conclusion to what we concluded on HW #2 from our analysis
 of the efficiency of the engine.
 Do they agree? If not, what do you think might account for the discrepancy?
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
Let's start with part a), we know that for a monoatomic ideal gas, the internal
 energy is just a function on the temperature, and even more, we know the
 functional relation, which is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=nC_{V}T\implies dU=nC_{v}dT,
\]

\end_inset

and even more, in virtue of the second law of thermodynamics, we have that
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
dU & =dQ-pdV,\\
\implies dQ & =dU+pdV.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and we also know that for an ideal gas, the following functional relationship
 (ideal gas equation) holds
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
pV=nRT,
\]

\end_inset

and now, we have everything we need to prove the proposition.
 By definition, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T}=\int_{A}^{B}\frac{1}{T}\left(dU+pdV\right),
\]

\end_inset

then, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T} & =\int_{A}^{B}\frac{1}{T}\left(nC_{v}dT+pdV\right),\\
\implies & =\int_{A}^{B}\frac{nC_{v}dT}{T}+\int_{A}^{B}\frac{pdV}{T},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and making use of the ideal gas equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T} & =\int_{A}^{B}\frac{nC_{v}dT}{T}+\int_{A}^{B}\frac{nRpdV}{pV},\\
 & =nC_{v}\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dT}{T}+nR\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dV}{V},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and from the previous relation we have, after integration, that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T}=nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{T_{B}}{T_{A}}\right)+nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and again, making use of the ideal gas equation, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T}=nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}}\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right)+nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and from the properties of the logarithm, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(xy\right)=\ln x+\ln y$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T} & =nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}}\right)+nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right)+nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),\\
\implies & =nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}}\right)+\left(nC_{v}+nR\right)\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

but for monoatomic gases, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{v}=\frac{3}{2}R$
\end_inset

, thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T}=\frac{3}{2}nR\ln\left(\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and therefore, the functional form of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the logarithmic function.

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 This problem explores the thermodynamics of a stretched rubber band.
 Because a stretched rubber band exerts a force 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, changing the length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 of the band does work on the band, which must be reflected in our expression
 for changes in the band’s internal energy
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dU=TdS-pdV+fdL,
\]

\end_inset

a) The 
\begin_inset Formula $dV$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dL$
\end_inset

 terms both represent work.
 Explain why they have opposite signs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) Write the comparable expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $dG$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
c) Use appropriate second derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 to derive a Maxwell relation between
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}\text{ and }\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial T}\right)_{L,p}
\]

\end_inset

d) This relationship means that you can determine the variation of entropy
 with length by measuring something completely different, and very accessible
 experimentally: the variation of force with temperature.
 The graph at right shows 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 (actually it shows something called the “storage modulus,” which has pressure
 units, but for a given rubber band, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is proportional to this quantity.).
 Based on these data and your result in (c), does the entropy of the rubber
 increase or decrease when it is stretched?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution.
 Let's begin with a) As the problem says, both 
\begin_inset Formula $dV$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dL$
\end_inset

 represent a form of work, but in one of those we found that the system
 in the one doing the work over the surroundings, while in the other, we
 have that the surroundings are doing work over the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) Let's move on with the calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $dG$
\end_inset

, and we know that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=H-TS;\hspace{1em}H=U+pV,
\]

\end_inset

thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=U+pV-TS,
\]

\end_inset

and its differential becomes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG=dU+Vdp+pdV-SdT-TdS,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies dG=\left(TdS-pdV+fdL\right)+Vdp+pdV-SdT-TdS,
\]

\end_inset

and as we can observe, some terms cancel, with each other, leaving us with
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG=Vdp-SdT+fdL.
\]

\end_inset

c) Now, we're going to make use of the previous relation, but before jumping
 with the math, let's remember the the property under which base the Maxwell
 relations, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial_{xy}\square=\partial_{yx}\square,
\]

\end_inset

or in words; we are assuming that the mixed derivatives commute with each
 other for any of this functions.
 Now, with this in mind, from the Gibbs free energy, we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial L}\right)_{p,V}=f,\hspace{1em}-\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p,L}=S,
\]

\end_inset

thus, from the two previous equations, making use of the commutativity of
 the mixed partial derivatives, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial T}\right)_{x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial L}\right)_{x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial L}\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{x}=-\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{x},
\]

\end_inset

where the subscript means keeping the appropriate variables constant.
 And with this we end up with the following Maxwell relation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial T}\right)_{L,p}=-\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}
\]

\end_inset

d) Now, from the figure we can see that we have a linear relation between
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 variables, thus we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(T\right)=mT+b,
\]

\end_inset

and even more, from the figure(experimental data) we can see that 
\begin_inset Formula $m>0$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $b>0$
\end_inset

, thus, in virtue of the derived Maxwell equation, previously derived, we
 have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial T}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(mT+b\right)=-\left(m+b\right)=\alpha,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\frac{dS}{dL}=\alpha,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha<0$
\end_inset

, thus, from the previous equation, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dS=\alpha dL\implies\Delta S=\alpha\Delta L,
\]

\end_inset

now, is we assume that we go from a lower stretch to a higher stretch, we
 can see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta L>0$
\end_inset

, and this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{\ensuremath{\Delta S<0,}}
\]

\end_inset

thus, the entropy decrease when we stretch the rubber.
