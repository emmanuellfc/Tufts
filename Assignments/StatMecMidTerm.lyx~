\begin_layout Problem
Let’s go back to the cyclical heat engine we’ve analyzed in the last two
 assignments.
 In this problem we’re going to work out the Clausius integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T}$
\end_inset

.
 We already know from HW #2 how to evaluate the contributions from the isotherma
l legs.
 It remains to deal with the linear ones.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
As the system moves along the path, P,V, and T all change.
 Show that, for a monatomic ideal gas:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int\frac{\delta Q}{T}=\frac{3}{2}nRf\left(p_{A},p_{B}\right)+\frac{5}{2}nRf\left(V_{A},V_{B}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and specify the form of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a,b)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using this result, calculate the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T}$
\end_inset

 for the entire cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What does your result imply regarding the reversibility of the cycle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Compare your conclusion to what we concluded on HW #2 from our analysis
 of the efficiency of the engine.
 Do they agree? If not, what do you think might account for the discrepancy?
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
Let's start:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We know that for a monoatomic ideal gas, the internal energy is just a function
 on the temperature, and even more, we know the functional relation, which
 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=nC_{v}T\implies dU=nC_{v}dT,
\]

\end_inset

and even more, in virtue of the second law of thermodynamics, we have that
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
dU & =dQ-pdV,\\
dQ & =dU+pdV.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and we also know that for an ideal gas, the following functional relationship
 (ideal gas equation) holds
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
pV=nRT,
\]

\end_inset

and now, we have everything we need to prove the proposition.
 By definition, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T}=\int_{A}^{B}\frac{1}{T}\left(dU+pdV\right),
\]

\end_inset

then, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T} & =\int_{A}^{B}\frac{1}{T}\left(nC_{v}dT+pdV\right),\\
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T} & =\int_{A}^{B}\frac{nC_{v}dT}{T}+\int_{A}^{B}\frac{pdV}{T},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and making use of the ideal gas equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T} & =\int_{A}^{B}\frac{nC_{v}dT}{T}+\int_{A}^{B}\frac{nRpdV}{pV},\\
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T} & =nC_{v}\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dT}{T}+nR\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dV}{V},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and from the previous relation we have, after integration, that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T}=nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{T_{B}}{T_{A}}\right)+nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and again, making use of the ideal gas equation, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T}=nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}}\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right)+nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and from the properties of the logarithm, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\left(xy\right)=\ln x+\ln y$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T} & =nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}}\right)+nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right)+nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),\\
\implies & =nC_{v}\ln\left(\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}}\right)+\left(nC_{v}+nR\right)\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

but for monoatomic gases, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{v}=\frac{3}{2}R$
\end_inset

, thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int_{A}^{B}\frac{dQ}{T}=\frac{3}{2}nR\ln\left(\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and therefore, the functional form of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is the logarithmic function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, for this second part we have that for both isothermal processes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{nR}\int\frac{dQ}{T}=\ln\left(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{3}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{4}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and for the first linear process we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{nR}\int_{2}^{3}\frac{dQ}{T}=\frac{3}{2}\ln\left(\frac{p_{3}}{p_{2}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{3}}{V_{2}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and using the ideal gas equation we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{nR}\int_{2}^{3}\frac{dQ}{T}=\frac{3}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{3}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{3}}{V_{2}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and for the other linear process
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{nR}\int_{4}^{1}\frac{dQ}{T}=\frac{3}{2}\ln\left(\frac{p_{4}}{p_{1}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{4}}{V_{1}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and again, making use of the ideal gas equation we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{nR}\int_{4}^{1}\frac{dQ}{T}=\frac{3}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{4}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{4}}{V_{1}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

thus, the integral over the whole cycle becomes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{nR}\oint\frac{dQ}{T}=\ln\left(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{3}}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{4}}\right)+\frac{3}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{3}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{3}}{V_{2}}\right)+\frac{3}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{4}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{4}}{V_{1}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{nR}\oint\frac{dQ}{T} & =\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{3}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{3}}{V_{2}}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{4}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{4}}{V_{1}}\right),\\
\frac{1}{nR}\oint\frac{dQ}{T} & =\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{3}}\right)-\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{3}}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{4}}{V_{1}}\right)+\frac{5}{2}\ln\left(\frac{V_{4}}{V_{1}}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and from this, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{nR}\oint\frac{dQ}{T}=2\ln\left(\frac{V_{4}}{V_{1}}\right)\neq0.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, from the previous equation, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\oint\frac{dQ}{T}\neq0,
\]

\end_inset

but we know that if the above closed integral is zero, then the process
 is reversible, thus, in this case the process is irreversible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, in the assignment #2, we found that the efficiency of this engine,
 was lower that a Carnot engine, which by construction is reversible, and
 even more, we know that all reversible engines share the same efficiency,
 thus, because the efficiency was lower that implied the process was irreversibl
e, and here, we prove the same statement, but using a different approach.

\begin_layout Problem
A typical battery for an internal- combustion-engine vehicle is a 12 Volt
 lead-acid battery, with a capacity of around 50 Ampere-hours.
 (Since an Ampere is a Coulomb per second, 50 Ah is a number of Coulombs.
 It tells you the amount of charge the battery can push through a circuit
 before it’s fully discharged.) The fundamental reaction is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Pb}+\text{Pb}\text{O}_{2}+4\text{H}^{+}+2\text{SO}_{4}^{2-}\rightarrow2\text{PbSO}_{4}+2\text{H}_{2}\text{O}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
How much electrical work can the battery provide before it’s fully discharged?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you want to know how much electrical work can be provided per mole of
 reactants, which thermodynamic parameter should you look at? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you want to know how much total energy is released per mole of reactants,
 which thermodynamic parameter should you look at? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the table, what are the values of the quantities mentioned in 2 and
 3? Are they the same? If not, where does the energy go or come from to
 account for the difference? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Based on your answer to 4, is the entropy of the products higher or lower
 than the entropy of the reactants? By how much (per mole)? Does your answer
 agree with what you find in the table? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each time the reaction occurs, two electrons are released by the reactants,
 flow through the external circuit, and then recombine with the products.
 Knowing this, what is the voltage provided by one such battery cell? A
 12 V battery has multiple cells arranged in series to give the full voltage.
 How many?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How many moles of SO42- would you expect the battery to contain? Does the
 order of magnitude of your answer seem reasonable? Why?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
Let's begin:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
We know that the voltage of the battery is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $V=12$
\end_inset

 Volt, and the capacity of the battery is 
\begin_inset Formula $50$
\end_inset

 Ah, thus the energy or electrical work will be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
W_{e} & =12\times50\left[\text{VAh}\right],\\
W_{e} & =600\text{\left[Wh\right],}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

thus the battery could provide a maximum amount of electrical work given
 by 600 Watts-hours 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For this we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G$
\end_inset

 is associated with the spontaneity of a physical or chemical change, and
 this, is also associated with the amount of work that a system can perform
 on the surroundings, but let's elaborate a little more on this; by definition,
 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=H-TS,
\]

\end_inset

thus, under constant pressure and temperature 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S,
\]

\end_inset

and from the above expression we can see that the first term on the RHS,
 under some conditions, could be interpreted as energy released to the environme
nt, and therefore used to work.
 On the other hand, the second term in the RHS is interpreted as increasing
 the entropy, thus, if we consider a process in which the system is always
 in equilibrium, in such a way that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, we can associate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta G$
\end_inset

 with the maximum amount of possible work.
 Therefore, I will look up for the change in Gibbs free energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We should look for the change in enthalpy; 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the total amount of thermal energy at a constant pressure, thus we can
 associate 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta H$
\end_inset

 as the difference in enthalpy between the products and reactants of a chemical
 reaction.
\end_layout

Here's the full reaction and a table with the information provided for this
 problem

As we can see, the values are different, but as stated in 2 and 3, Gibbs
 free energy is associated with the maximum amount of possible work, whereas
 the enthalpy is associated with the total amount of energy at constant
 pressure.
 Thus they are related but they not necessarily coincide, and even more,
 in the discussion for the work and the Gibbs free energy we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S\rightarrow0$

In order to solve all of these questions we need going to remember the definitio
n of the thermodynamical potentials, thus, it's a good idea to write the
 definitions;
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
dU & =TdS-pdV\leftarrow\text{(Internal Energy)},\\
dH & =TdS+Vdp\leftarrow\text{(Enthalpy)},\\
dF & =-SdT-pdV,\leftarrow\text{(Free Energy)},\\
dG & =-SdT+Vdp\leftarrow\text{(Gibbs)},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

now, let's move on to the questions.
\end_layout

We know that the internal energy is a function of the entropy and the volume,
 this is 
\begin_inset Formula $U=U\left(T,p\right)$

.
 On the other hand, for the Enthalpy, we have a contribution from the entropy
 and the pressure, but because in this case there's no variation in the
 former, we have just one contribution, this is, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dU=TdS-pdV\implies\Delta U=T\Delta S-p\Delta V,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula

dH=TdS\implies\Delta H=T\Delta S,
\]

\end_inset

now, if we compare the above expressions we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta U=\Delta H-p\Delta V,
\]

\end_inset

and from we can use the information given un the statement of the problem
 about the fact that ice decreases it's volume by about 10% when melting,
 and this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V=-10\%$
\end_inset

, and this is negative because we're seeing a reduction in the volume, then
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta U=\Delta H+\alpha,\hspace{1em}\alpha=p\Delta V>0,
\]

\end_inset

and from this we have that the change in internal energy is 10% higher than
 the change in enthalpy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For this part we have that the Gibbs free energy is function of the change
 in temperature and the change in pressure, but both of those state variables
 are kept constant during the phase transition, therefore, this implies
 that the change in Gibbs free energy is zero.
 Now, in math terms, what we have is the following 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG=-SdT+Vdp,
\]

\end_inset

and for a finite change, not a differential change, we need to integrate
 the previous expression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta G=-\int S(T)dT+\int V(p)dp,
\]

\end_inset

but in this case, there's no variation in the temperature nor in the pressure,
 because of the physical constraints of the system, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta G=0.
\]

\end_inset

Now, for the following two problems, we have to remember that in a first
 order phase transition there are some parameters which are discontinuous,
 and we can associate a latent heat to the transition, in this case we're
 talking about melting and vaporization of water.
 Now, for we can associate the change in entropy and the latent heat as
 follows 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
L=\Delta Q=T_{c}\left(S_{2}-S_{1}\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the latent heat,
\begin_inset Formula $T_{c}$
\end_inset

 is the transition temperature and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2},S_{1}$
\end_inset

 are the entropies at the phases 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Thus, going from ice to liquid we have that the change in entropy is given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S=\frac{L}{T_{c}}=\frac{6.01\times10^{3}}{273.15}\left[\frac{\text{J/mol}}{\text{K}}\right],
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\Delta S=22.0\frac{\text{J/mol}}{\text{K}}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the other hand, going from liquid to gas, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S=\frac{L}{T_{c}}=\frac{40.7\times10^{3}}{373.15}\left[\frac{\text{J/mol}}{\text{K}}\right],
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S=109.1\frac{\text{J/mol}}{\text{K}}.

\begin_layout Problem

Statement
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose a warm stone, at temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}^{0}$
\end_inset

, is placed in a container of cool water, at temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{w}^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 As the combined system comes to thermal equilibrium, at some final temperature
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}$
\end_inset

, heat flows between the stone and the water.
 Assuming that the combined system does not exchange energy with its surrounding
s, show that the total change of entropy of the combined system as it approaches
 equilibrium, 
\begin_inset Formula $ΔS_{s}+ΔS_{w}$
\end_inset

 is necessarily positive.
 Would the result be different if the stone were initially cooler than the
 water?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Suppose a fixed amount of gas is enclosed in a sealed container with a freely
 moving piston, so its volume can change and it can exchange heat with its
 surroundings.
 It is placed inside a much larger bath, which is at temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, and allowed to come (quasi-statically) to equilibrium.
 In the process, the gas transfers an amount of heat 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\text{bath}}$
\end_inset

 (which may be positive or negative) into the bath.
 Relate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\text{bath}}$
\end_inset

 to the change in enthalpy of the gas, and use that relationship to show
 that maximizing the total entropy change of the combined system corresponds
 to minimizing the Gibbs free energy G of the gas.
 (Because the bath is large, we can assume 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 do not change.)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
Let's begin: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
For this we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S_{i}=\int\frac{dQ_{i}}{T},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2$
\end_inset

 refers to the stone and the water in the container.
 Now, we know that once in thermal contact, after some time, they will be
 in thermodynamical equilibrium at some temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}$
\end_inset

, and in the following I'm going to use the following notation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{s}^{0}\rightarrow T_{1},\hspace{1em}T_{w}^{0}\rightarrow T_{2},
\]

\end_inset

then, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S_{1}=\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{f}}\frac{dQ_{1}}{T},\hspace{1em}\Delta S_{2}=\int_{T_{2}}^{T_{f}}\frac{dQ_{2}}{T},
\]

\end_inset

and, even more, for for a reversible heat transfer we have 
\begin_inset Formula $dQ_{i}=C_{i}dT$
\end_inset

, where in general 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}>0$
\end_inset

 , thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S_{1}=\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{f}}\frac{C_{1}\left(T\right)dT}{T},\hspace{1em}\Delta S_{2}=\int_{T_{2}}^{T_{f}}\frac{C_{2}\left(T\right)dT}{T},
\]

\end_inset

then, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S=\Delta S_{1}+\Delta S_{2}=\int_{T_{1}}^{T_{f}}\frac{C_{1}\left(T\right)dT}{T}+\int_{T_{2}}^{T_{f}}\frac{C_{2}\left(T\right)dT}{T},
\]

\end_inset

but for the first integral we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}<T_{1}$
\end_inset

 and the integrand is an increasing function, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S_{1}<0,
\]

\end_inset

on the other hand, for the second integral 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}>T_{2}$
\end_inset

, and again, for being an increasing function, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S_{2}>0,
\]

\end_inset

now we must show that even with one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S_{i}$
\end_inset

 negative, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S$
\end_inset

 (i.e, the sum)is still positive.
 And for this we're going to simplify a little our model, we're going to
 consider that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1},C_{2}$
\end_inset

 are constants, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S_{1}=C_{1}\ln\left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{1}}\right),\hspace{1em}\Delta S_{2}=C_{2}\ln\left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{2}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and from this, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S=C_{1}\ln\left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{1}}\right)+C_{2}\ln\left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{2}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and in order to find 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{1}+Q_{2}=0\iff C_{1}\left(T_{f}-T_{1}\right)+C_{2}\left(T_{f}-T_{2}\right)=0,
\]

\end_inset

and from this, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{f}\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)-\left(C_{1}T_{1}+C_{2}T_{2}\right)=0,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies T_{f}=\frac{\left(C_{1}T_{1}+C_{2}T_{2}\right)}{\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)}=\frac{C_{1}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}T_{1}+\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}T_{2},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore T_{f}=\frac{C_{1}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}T_{1}+\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}T_{2},
\]

\end_inset

and now, if we define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha=\frac{C_{1}}{C_{1}+C_{2}},
\]

\end_inset

we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha-1=\frac{C_{1}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}-1=\frac{C_{1}-\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)}{C_{1}+C_{2}}=-\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\frac{C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}=1-\alpha,
\]

\end_inset

and then 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{f}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{f}=\alpha T_{1}+\left(1-\alpha\right)T_{2},
\]

\end_inset

now, let's use this relation in the total change in entropy
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Delta S & =C_{1}\ln\left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{1}}\right)+C_{2}\ln\left(\frac{T_{f}}{T_{2}}\right),\\
 & =C_{1}\ln\left(\frac{\alpha T_{1}+\left(1-\alpha\right)T_{2}}{T_{1}}\right)+C_{2}\ln\left(\frac{\alpha T_{1}+\left(1-\alpha\right)T_{2}}{T_{2}}\right),\\
 & =\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\ln\left(\alpha T_{1}+\left(1-\alpha\right)T_{2}\right)-C_{1}\ln T_{1}-C_{2}\ln T_{2},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

but 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C_{1}=\alpha\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\text{ \& }C_{2}=\left(1-\alpha\right)\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right),
\]

\end_inset

then naming 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=-C_{1}\ln T_{1}-C_{2}\ln T_{2}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\beta & =-\alpha\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\ln T_{1}-\left(1-\alpha\right)\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\ln T_{2,}\\
\beta & =-\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\left(\alpha\ln T_{1}+\left(1-\alpha\right)\ln T_{2,}\right),\\
\beta & =-\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\left(\ln T_{1}^{\alpha}+\ln T_{2,}^{1-\alpha}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

then, finally 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta=-\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\left(\ln T_{1}^{\alpha}T_{2,}^{1-\alpha}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and from this, we have that the total change in entropy is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Delta S & =\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\ln\left(\alpha T_{1}+\left(1-\alpha\right)T_{2}\right)-\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\left(\ln T_{1}^{\alpha}T_{2,}^{1-\alpha}\right)\\
\Delta S & =\left(C_{1}+C_{2}\right)\ln\left(\frac{\alpha T_{1}+\left(1-\alpha\right)T_{2}}{T_{1}^{\alpha}T_{2,}^{1-\alpha}}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

now, in order to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta S>0$
\end_inset

, we have to prove that the function is increasing, and the logarithm is
 an increasing function, as long as the value inside the function is increasing,
 and indeed, this is the case because 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is bounded to live between 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

, and this comes purely from its definition, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha T_{1}+\left(1-\alpha\right)T_{2}>0,
\]

\end_inset

and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S>0,
\]

\end_inset

and finally, if we take into consideration the other case in which the stone
 were colder instead of hotter, the same reasoning applies, and therefore
 in that case the total change in entropy also increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now for this part, when we transfer energy dU and volume dV from the surrounding
s, to the system we have that the internal energy of the surrounding changes
 by an amount 
\begin_inset Formula $dU_{0}$
\end_inset

 which is given by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dU_{0}=-dU=T_{0}dS_{0}-p_{0}\left(dV\right),
\]

\end_inset

where the minus sign reflect the fact that the energy and volume is decreasing.
 Then, from the previous expression we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dS_{0}=-\frac{dU+p_{0}dV}{T_{0}},
\]

\end_inset

now, if the entropy of the system changes by dS, then the total change in
 the entropy 
\begin_inset Formula $dS_{0}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dS_{\text{tot}}=dS_{0}+dS,
\]

\end_inset

and using the second law, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{0}dS_{\text{tot}}=-\left[dU+p_{0}dV-T_{0}dS\right]\ge0,
\]

\end_inset

and therefore, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dU+p_{0}dV-T_{0}dS\leq0.
\]

\end_inset

And now, if we assume that the system can be approximated as a system with
 constant pressure and temperature, we can use the definition of the Gibbs
 free energy, as follows 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG=dU+p_{0}dV+Vdp-T_{0}dS-SdT=dU-T_{0}dS+p_{0}dV,
\]

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $dp=dT=0$
\end_inset

, and from and the condition for the previous equation, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG\leq0,
\]

\end_inset

and from this we have that maximizing the total entropy change of the combined
 system corresponds to minimizing the Gibbs free energy G of the gas.

 Based on these data and your result in (c), does the entropy of the rubber

\begin_layout Solution*
Let's begin: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
As the problem says, both 
\begin_inset Formula $dV$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $dL$
\end_inset

 represent a form of work, but in one of those we found that the system
 in the one doing the work over the surroundings, while in the other, we
 have that the surroundings are doing work over the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let's move on with the calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $dG$
\end_inset

, and we know that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=H-TS;\hspace{1em}H=U+pV,
\]

\end_inset

thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=U+pV-TS,
\]

\end_inset

and its differential becomes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG=dU+Vdp+pdV-SdT-TdS,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies dG=\left(TdS-pdV+fdL\right)+Vdp+pdV-SdT-TdS,
\]

\end_inset

and as we can observe, some terms cancel, with each other, leaving us with
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG=Vdp-SdT+fdL.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, we're going to make use of the previous relation, but before jumping
 with the math, let's remember the the property under which base the Maxwell
 relations, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\partial_{xy}\square=\partial_{yx}\square,
\]

\end_inset

or in words; we are assuming that the mixed derivatives commute with each
 other for any of this functions.
 Now, with this in mind, from the Gibbs free energy, we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial L}\right)_{p,V}=f,\hspace{1em}-\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p,L}=S,
\]

\end_inset

thus, from the two previous equations, making use of the commutativity of
 the mixed partial derivatives, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial T}\right)_{x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial L}\right)_{x}=\frac{\partial}{\partial L}\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{x}=-\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{x},
\]

\end_inset

where the subscript means keeping the appropriate variables constant.
 And with this we end up with the following Maxwell relation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial T}\right)_{L,p}=-\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, from the figure we can see that we have a linear relation between the
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 variables, thus we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(T\right)=mT+b,
\]

\end_inset

and even more, from the figure(experimental data) we can see that 
\begin_inset Formula $m>0$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $b>0$
\end_inset

, thus, in virtue of the derived Maxwell equation, previously derived, we
 have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial T}=-\frac{\partial}{\partial T}\left(mT+b\right)=-m,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\frac{dS}{dL}=\alpha,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=-m<0$
\end_inset

, thus, from the previous equation, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dS=\alpha dL\implies\Delta S=\alpha\Delta L,
\]

\end_inset

now, is we assume that we go from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 stretch to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

higher
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 stretch, we can see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta L>0$
\end_inset

, and this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{\ensuremath{\Delta S<0,}}
\]

\end_inset

thus, the entropy decrease when we stretch the rubber.
