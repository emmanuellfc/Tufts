The figure shows the P-V diagram for the same cyclical process that you
 analyzed on HW1.
 Now we’re going to think of it as an unlikely, but conceivable, cyclic
 heat engine.
 Assume that the working medium is a monatomic ideal gas, and, of course,
 that all steps are quasi-static.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
a) What is the efficiency of this engine? Explain your analysis, and, in
 the end, give a numerical value.
 You don’t have to repeat the calculations of work and heat that you did
 on HW #1; just use the results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
b) What would be the efficiency of a Carnot engine operating between the
 same two temperatures? Again, give a numerical value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
c) Could the cycle shown in the figure represent a reversible process? How
 do you know? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
d) If the working medium were a diatomic ideal gas, would the efficiency
 of the engine be lower, higher, or the same? (You shouldn’t need to redo
 the whole calculation; just look at where that change would make a difference.)

\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=\frac{W}{Q},
\]

\end_inset

thus, the efficiency is the ratio of the work out to the heat in.
 Now, in this particular process the heat and work for each part of the
 cycle are given by

For this part, we have to remember the definition of a reversible process,
 which is described as the process where both the system and its surroundings
 can be returned to their exact starting states without leaving any other
 changes in the universe.
 This is an idealization and in nature no process is reversible, however,
 I think with enough care, we could get close to that ideal process ~ reversible.

 heat and the work is changed (higher) for the stages

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $4$

A Carnot engine is defined as one that is reversible.
 The Carnot cycle is a particular type of ideal-gas engine that uses two
 isothermal steps joined by two adiabatic steps.
 But how do we know that the Carnot cycle is in fact reversible (and therefore
 represents a Carnot engine)?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Clausius’s theorem tells us that for a reversible cycle 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\oint\frac{dQ}{T}=0
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Our analysis of the Carnot cycle is based on the ideal gas definition of
 temperature.
 We also defined a thermodynamic temperature scale based on the requirement
 that the efficiency of any reversible engine is 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{C}=1-\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$
\end_inset

.
 Show, by direct analysis of the heat and work in each stage of the cycle,
 that the efficiency of the Carnot cycle (calculated using the ideal gas
 definition of temperature) agrees with this relationship.
 That result confirms the equivalency of the two temperature scales

we have the following: by definition, the Carnot cycle is given by two isotherms
 stages and two adiabatic stages, as shown in the next figure:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Solution*
On the other hand, by definition, the adiabatic stages are processes in
 which there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, thus, the calculation
 of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T},
\]

\end_inset

reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T}=\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}+\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}},
\]

\end_inset

now, before jumping into that calculation, let's remember some expressions
 for each stage in this cyclic process:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the isothermal expansion, we have the following equation for the 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{h}=RT_{h}\ln\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the adiabatic expansion, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{T_{h}}{T_{c}}\right)=\left(\frac{V_{C}}{V_{B}}\right)^{\gamma-1},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For the isothermal compression, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{c}=-RT_{c}\ln\frac{V_{D}}{V_{C}},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And finally, for the adiabatic compression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{T_{c}}{T_{h}}\right)=\left(\frac{V_{A}}{V_{D}}\right)^{\gamma-1},
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, from the information in the two adiabatic steps, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{V_{C}}{V_{B}}\right)^{\gamma-1}=\left(\frac{T_{h}}{T_{c}}\right)=\left(\frac{V_{A}}{V_{D}}\right)^{1-\gamma},
\]

\end_inset

then, it follows that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left(\frac{V_{C}}{V_{B}}\right)^{\gamma-1} & =\left(\frac{V_{D}}{V_{A}}\right)^{\gamma-1},\\
\implies\frac{V_{C}}{V_{B}} & =\frac{V_{D}}{V_{A}},\\
\implies\frac{V_{C}}{V_{D}} & =\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now, if we plug this, into the heat for the isothermal compression, we have
 that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q_{c}=-RT_{c}\ln\frac{V_{D}}{V_{C}}=RT_{c}\ln\frac{V_{C}}{V_{D}},
\]

\end_inset

then, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Q_{c} & =RT_{c}\ln\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}},\\
\implies\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}} & =R\ln\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}}.
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now, for the isothermal expansion we have a similar expression, this is
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}=R\ln\frac{V_{B}}{V_{A}},
\]

\end_inset

then, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}} & =\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}}\\
\implies\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}-\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}} & =0,\\
\therefore\oint\frac{\delta Q}{T} & =0,
\end{align*}

\end_inset

just as we wanted to prove.

For this part, we're going to make use of one of the relationships previously
 proved, that is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{Q_{c}}{T_{c}}=\frac{Q_{h}}{T_{h}},
\]

\end_inset

now, in general the efficiency is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=\frac{W}{Q},
\]

\end_inset

but given the setup of the system, this equations can be expressed as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=\frac{Q_{h}-Q_{c}}{Q_{h}},
\]

\end_inset

therefore, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=1-\frac{Q_{c}}{Q_{h}},
\]

\end_inset

but using the relationship stated at the beginning of the problem, we have
 that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=1-\frac{T_{c}}{T_{h}},
\]

\end_inset

which corresponds to the efficiency to any reversible engine, and thus,
 the efficiency of Carnot's engine agrees with this expression.

We customarily show ideal gas processes in a

 In such a diagram you can read changes in internal energy and work directly
 from the diagram, but you the have to infer heat from those values and
 the First Law.
 Isobaric and isochoric processes are represented by horizontal and vertical
 lines, while isothermal and adiabatic processes are represented by curves.
 For reversible processes, it’s also possible to use an

 which in this case will correspond to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=\left(T_{h}-T_{c}\right)\left(S_{h}-S_{c}\right),
\]

\end_inset

now for the heat, we need to make use the of the first law, and in this
 case, because the process is cyclic, the change in internal energy is zero,
 thus 
\begin_inset Formula

Q=-W.

Finally, for the efficiency, we have, in virtue of the second law

\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dQ_{3}=T_{c}dS\implies Q_{3}=T_{c}\left(S_{D}-S_{C}\right)=T_{c}\left(S_{A}-S_{B}\right),

\end_inset

now, with this at hand, we can obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=\frac{W}{Q_{h}}=\frac{T_{h}\left(S_{B}-S_{A}\right)+T_{c}\left(S_{A}-S_{B}\right)}{T_{h}\left(S_{B}-S_{A}\right)}=\frac{\left(T_{h}-T_{c}\right)\left(S_{B}-S_{A}\right)}{T_{h}\left(S_{B}-S_{A}\right)},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\eta=1-\frac{T_{c}}{T_{h}},

\end_inset

which corresponds to our known definition.

There is great interest these days in heat pumps for heating buildings,
 as alternatives to burning fossil fuels.
 A heat pump is essentially a refrigerator (or air conditioner) in which
 an electrical motor provides the work required to pump heat from a cold
 reservoir (the outside air) into a hot reservoir (the warm air inside the
 building).
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A heat pump can deliver several times as much heat energy as the amount
 of electrical energy is uses (unlike, for example, an electric space heater,
 where the heat delivered is exactly equal to the electrical energy used.)
 A friend of yours, who has never studied thermal physics, wants to know
 how that can possibly be true.
 Provide an accurate but accessible explanation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When the outside temperature is moderate, the COP of a heat pump (the ratio
 of the heat delivered to the building to the electrical energy used) can
 be on the order of 5 or 6, but as the outside temperature drops, so does
 the COP, as shown in the figure.
 Explain, in terms of fundamental thermodynamics, why such a drop in COP
 is unavoidable.
 (You’re not expected to account quantitatively for the values, just for
 the qualitative trend.)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
a) For this part I think the main issue relies on the fact that a heat pump
 is moving heat, instead of generating it, and it turns out that it's easier
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

move heat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than generate, or at least in the majority of the cases, it could be possible
 to make a heat pump very inefficient.
 Again, the principal thing here is that there are many ways in which you
 can transport heat, and for that process the amount of work is lower than
 in the generation process.

You may be aware that the temperature at which water boils decreases with
 decreasing atmospheric pressure, so it is lower in Denver, for example,
 than in Boston.
 The Clausius-Clapeyron equation describes the change of the boiling point
 of a liquid with pressure.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dP}{dT}=\frac{L_{vap}}{T\Delta V}.
\]

\end_inset

Where 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{vap}$
\end_inset

 is the latent heat of vaporization and 
\begin_inset Formula $ΔV$

 is the change in volume between the liquid and gas phases.

Imagine a Carnot steam engine that uses 1 mole of water as its working medium.
 It takes heat 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{h}=L$
\end_inset

 from the hot reservoir at 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 boiling, converting the water at pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 into water vapor, increasing its volume by 
\begin_inset Formula $ΔV$
\end_inset

.
 The vapor then expands adiabatically, reducing its pressure to 
\begin_inset Formula $P–dP$
\end_inset

, and its temperature to 
\begin_inset Formula $T–dT$
\end_inset

.
 (The volume also increases, but the change is very small compared to the
 change between liquid and vapor, so the work done in this step can be neglected.
) The vapor then condenses back into liquid water, decreasing its volume
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $ΔV$
\end_inset

.
 To complete the cycle, the liquid water is brought back to its original
 state 
\begin_inset Formula $(P,T)$
\end_inset

 with essentially no change in volume.

A hurricane can be thought of as a heat engine that operates something like
 the idealized steam engine described above (see this article from Physics
 Today).
 The primary source of work is the evaporation and condensation of water.
 The high- temperature reservoir is the ocean surface, at a temperature
 of about 300 K.
 The low-temperature reservoir is the upper atmosphere, at a temperature
 of about 200 K.
 Water evaporates from the ocean surface.
 The water vapor, mixed with air, undergoes adiabatic expansion as it rises
 and cools, and condenses into clouds in the upper atmosphere.
 (In real hurricanes it isn’t the same air/water mixture that cycles back
 to close the loop, but that doesn’t really matter to the analysis.) The
 work drives the hurricane’s winds ─ in steady state the kinetic energy
 of the winds is dissipated by surface friction.
 To be self-sustaining, a hurricane needs to vaporize and condense about
 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{11}$
\end_inset

 kg/hour of water.
 Estimate the maximum power output of such a hurricane, in watts.
 Compare that value to something that allows you to place it in some kind
 of meaningful context.

For this part of the problem let's start with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dP}{dT}=\frac{L}{T\Delta V},
\]

\end_inset

now, in our case 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the change of the vapor water and the volume of the liquid
 water, thus, if we consider that 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{gas}\gg V_{liq}$
\end_inset

, then we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dP}{dT}=\frac{L}{TV},
\]

\end_inset

and if we also consider the vapor water as an ideal gas, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{dP}{dT} & =\frac{L}{\frac{RT^{2}}{P}},\\
\implies\frac{dP}{dT} & =\frac{LP}{RT^{2}}\\
\implies\frac{dP}{P} & =\frac{LdT}{RT^{2}},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and the solution for this differential equation s given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}}\right)=-\frac{L}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{T1}\right),
\]

\end_inset

now if we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{1}=1$
\end_inset

 atm, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}=373$
\end_inset

 K, and (digging) in the web I found that pressure in Denver is 
\begin_inset Formula $0.85$
\end_inset

 atm, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln\left(0.83\right)=\frac{L}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{373}\right),
\]

\end_inset

now, in this case 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{L}{R}=5092$
\end_inset

 K, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{\ln\left(0.85\right)}{-592}=\frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{373},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{T_{2}}=0.000036592+\frac{1}{373},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\frac{1}{T_{2}}=0.0027175,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies T_{2}=\frac{1}{0.0027175},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore T_{2}=367.985\text{ K },
\]

\end_inset

and this results is lower, as expected.

\begin_layout Solution*
c) First let's focus on the work, we know that in a 
\begin_inset Formula $P-V$
\end_inset

 diagram, the work corresponds to the area of the cycle, thus, in this case,
 the area is simply 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w_{by}=\Delta VdP.
\]

\end_inset

Now, with this results at hand, we can prove the Clausius-Clapeyron equation
 as follows: by definition, the efficiency is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=\frac{W}{Q_{h}},
\]

\end_inset

but in our case we have the following relations 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\eta=\frac{dT}{T},\hspace{1em}W=\Delta VdP,\hspace{1em}Q_{h}=L,
\]

\end_inset

thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\frac{dT}{T} & =\frac{\Delta VdP}{L}\\
\implies\frac{dP}{dT} & =\frac{L}{T\Delta V},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

just as we wanted.

For this problem, we know that the latent heat of vaporization of water
 is about 
\begin_inset Formula $2,260$
\end_inset

 kJ/kg, thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{Power}=2260\left[\frac{\text{kJ}}{\text{kg}}\right]\times10^{11}\left[\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{hour}}\right]=2.63\times10^{17}\text{\left[\frac{\text{J}}{\text{hour}}\right]}

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
a) What is something specific you understand better than you did before?
\series default
 I think I've seen much of this material in the past, except for the Clausius-Cl
apeyron, I thing I used that equation ages ago, so I think it was a good
 thing for me to do some exercises on that, and remember how those things
 operate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
b) What is something specific that surprised, confused, or intrigued you,
 or that you struggled with?
\series default
 Heat flow and the sign of work is always a little difficult to me, mainly
 because of the conventions, I still have a hard time getting used to the
 convention that we're using.
 On the other hand I feel more comfortable with the math behind, so, I always
 try to thing on those terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
c) What is something that this problem set made you want to know more about?
\series default
 I think this problem set required a little bit more maths than the previous
 one, so I really like that part, and because of that I really want to start
 doing things in statistical mechanics, ensembles, probability distributions,
 and maybe work a little bit more with the computer.
