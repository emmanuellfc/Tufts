\begin_layout Problem
Return to the rubber band problem from the mid-semester assessment.
 We arrived at
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG=-SdT+Vdp+fdL.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Show that we can write the force as the sum of an enthalpic term and an
 entropic term:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}-T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the Maxwell relation derived previously, along with the data in the
 graph, estimate (numerically) the fraction of the elasticity of the rubber
 (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

) that comes from the entropic term.
 Because you’re working with ratios, the distinction between force and modulus
 doesn’t matter ─ the geometrical factors that connect them cancel out.
 Which term (enthalpic or entropic) dominates?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
From your result, does the rubber band get warmer or colder when you stretch
 it? When it retracts to its original length? If you have a rubber band
 handy, test your conclusion empirically and report the results.
 (Lips are sensitive differential thermometers.)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
Let's start by writing the expression 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
dG=-SdT+Vdp+fdL.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
From that expression we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p},
\]

\end_inset

and on the other hand, the definition of Gibbs free energy is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G=H-TS,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 is the enthalpy, and from this definition, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}-\left(\frac{\partial\left(TS\right)}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p},
\]

\end_inset

but because we're keeping the temperature constant we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}-T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p},
\]

\end_inset

and from this we can obtain the following expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}-T\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p},
\]

\end_inset

and from this we can see that the force can be written in terms of an enthalpic
 term and an entropic term.
 And even more, the previous equation has the following functional form
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f=mT+b,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m=-\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}\hspace{1em}\&\hspace{1em}b=\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p},
\]

\end_inset

but from the figure we can see that the slope is positive, this is 
\begin_inset Formula $m>0$
\end_inset

, and this implies that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}<0,
\]

\end_inset

which means that stretching brings makes the system more ordered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, we are going to calculate the contribution of the entropic term, this
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial L}\right)_{T,p}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m=\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta T}\approx\frac{0.22-0.17}{200-140},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies m\approx\frac{0.05}{60}\approx0.00083,
\]

\end_inset

thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m\approx0.00083\frac{N}{mm^{2}K},
\]

\end_inset

and even more, from the figure we can see that the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, this is, the term associated to the enthalpy is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, for the the entropic term we have: fixing the temperature
 at around 200, we have the product 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
mT & \approx0.00083\times200,\\
 & \approx0.17,
\end{align*}

\end_inset

but from the figure we can see that, 
\begin_inset Formula $b<0.17$
\end_inset

, and this is if we assume that the behavior is linear for all temperatures,
 something that sounds weird, but at first approximation sees reasonable.
 And with this analysis we can see that 
\series bold
the entropic term dominates
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, if we stretch the rubber that means we're in some sense in high
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, and this implies that the temperature should be higher, something that
 agrees with our everyday experience when we stretch a rubber band.

In part two in not quite sure of the numbers, because my approximation was

With the data from the figure I tried to extract the information of the
 plots using Mathematica, and then do a linear fit, but it was a little
 tricky, and I think this part was very instructive; recently I had to do
 the same with one paper because they didn't provide a table with the numerical
 values and I needed to compare my solution with theirs.

\begin_layout Problem
In this problem you will calculate analytically the vibrational contribution
 to the energy of a diatomic molecule as a function of temperature, and,
 by making suitable approximations, consider the behavior in the low- and
 high-temperature limits.
 Model the molecule quantum mechanically as a particle in a three-dimensional
 infinite square (i.e.
 cubical) well of side length 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 that is also able to vibrate internally at frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 Represent the vibrational as a quantum harmonic oscillator.
 The center-of-mass and vibrational degrees of freedom are independent.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
What are the quantum numbers that define a microstate of the molecule? What
 is the energy of the microstate in terms of those quantum numbers?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Calculate the partition function 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

.
 You can assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is very large, so that the spacing between center-of-mass states is much
 smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T$
\end_inset

, but do not assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar\omega$
\end_inset

 is small compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Using the relation 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle U\right\rangle =k_{B}T^{2}\frac{\partial\ln Z}{\partial T}
\]

\end_inset

find the average energy of the molecule at low temperature, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T\ll\hbar\omega$
\end_inset

.
 Compare your result to what is expected from classical equipartition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Find the average energy of the molecule at high temperature, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T\gg\hbar\omega$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How does this calculation relate to the analysis we did in HW 1, Prob 5.?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
Sol.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Formally, we have to solve the Schrödinger equation, and in this case we
 have two contributions to the energy, one is given by the particle in a
 box, and the other is given by the vibration modes.
 In the case of a particle in a box, which is the contribution for the translati
onal degrees of freedom, we have a contribution in the energy as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{i}^{\left(fp\right)}=\frac{\hbar^{2}n_{i}^{2}}{2m},\hspace{1em}i\in\left\{ x,y,z\right\} ,
\]

\end_inset

and the contribution for the vibrational degrees of freedom is given by
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{j}^{\left(sho\right)}=\left(n_{j}+\frac{1}{2}\right)\hbar\omega,\hspace{1em}j\in\{1,2\},
\]

\end_inset

therefore, the energy total energy is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{ij}=E_{i}^{\left(fp\right)}+E_{j}^{\left(sho\right)},
\]

\end_inset

and there's a reason for the notation, which will be clear in a moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Once we have the energies, we can write the partition function, but there's
 a nice result which I want to exploit: if the total energy of s system
 can be decomposed in a sum of various independent contributions, them then
 the total partition function is the product of several partition functions,
 this is, if 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E_{ij}=E_{i}^{\left(a\right)}+E_{j}^{\left(b\right)},
\]

\end_inset

then, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Z & =\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\exp\left[-\beta\left(E_{i}^{\left(a\right)}+E_{j}^{\left(b\right)}\right)\right],\\
 & =\sum_{i}\exp\left[-\beta E_{i}^{\left(a\right)}\right]\sum_{j}\exp\left[-\beta+E_{j}^{\left(b\right)}\right],\\
 & =Z_{a}Z_{b},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and with this result at hand, we know that we usually deal with 
\begin_inset Formula $ln\left(Z\right)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 itself, and in this case we have exactly that, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\ln Z & =\ln\left(Z_{a}Z_{b}\right),\\
 & =\ln Z_{a}+\ln Z_{b},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

therefore the energy will be given as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left\langle U\right\rangle =k_{B}T^{2}\frac{\partial\ln Z_{a}Z_{b}}{\partial T},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\left\langle U\right\rangle =k_{B}T^{2}\left(\frac{\partial\ln Z_{a}}{\partial T}+\frac{\partial\ln Z_{b}}{\partial T}\right),
\]

\end_inset

Now, with this in mind, we have, our particular problem 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z=\sum_{i}\sum_{j}\exp\left[-\beta\left(E_{i}^{\left(fp\right)}+E_{j}^{\left(sho\right)}\right)\right],
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies Z=\sum_{i}\exp\left[-\beta E_{i}^{\left(fp\right)}\right]\sum_{j}\exp\left[-\beta E_{j}^{\left(sho\right)}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and from this we have to calculate the contribution for each one this is
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{fp}\hspace{1em}\&\hspace{1em}Z_{sho},
\]

\end_inset

but using the same idea we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{fp}=Z_{1},\hspace{1em}\&\hspace{1em}Z_{sho}=Z_{2}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the partition functions of the particle in a box, and the simple harmonic
 oscillator, but in 1D, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{trans}=Vn_{Q},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{Q}$
\end_inset

 is the quantum concentration, which is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n_{Q}=\frac{1}{\hbar^{3}}\left(\frac{mk_{B}T}{2\pi}\right)^{3/2},
\]

\end_inset

but let's rewrite it in a more convenient way, this is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Z_{trans} & =\frac{V}{\hbar^{3}}\left(\frac{m}{2\pi}\right)^{3/2}\left(k_{B}T\right)^{3/2},\\
Z_{trans} & =\alpha\beta^{-3/2},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\alpha=\frac{V}{\hbar^{3}}\left(\frac{m}{2\pi}\right)^{3/2},\hspace{1em}\beta=\frac{1}{k_{B}T}
\]

\end_inset

and for the simple harmonic oscillator we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{vib}=\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\beta\hbar\omega\right)}{1-\exp\left(-\beta\hbar\omega\right)}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the other hand, for this kind of calculations it's easier to take derivatives
 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, or at least for the energy it's quite convenient, this using the chain
 rule we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=k_{B}T^{2}\frac{\partial\ln Z}{\partial T}=-\frac{d}{d\beta}\ln Z,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies U=-\frac{d}{d\beta}\ln Z,
\]

\end_inset

but as stated before the partition function is the product of two independent
 contributions, thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
U & =U_{trans}+U_{vib},\\
 & =-\left[\frac{d}{d\beta}\ln Z_{trans}+-\frac{d}{d\beta}\ln Z_{vib}\right],
\end{align*}

\end_inset

thus for 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{trans}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
U_{trans} & =-\frac{d}{d\beta}\ln Z_{trans}\\
 & =-\frac{d}{d\beta}\left[\ln\left(\alpha\beta^{-3/2}\right)\right],\\
 & =-\frac{d}{d\beta}\left[\ln\alpha-\frac{3}{2}\ln\beta\right],
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and from this we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{trans}=\frac{3}{2}\frac{d}{d\beta}\ln\beta,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies U_{trans}=\frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{\beta}
\]

\end_inset

therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{trans}=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T.
\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, for 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{vib}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
U_{vib} & =-\frac{d}{d\beta}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\beta\hbar\omega\right)}{1-\exp\left(-\beta\hbar\omega\right)}\right)\right],\\
 & =-\frac{d}{d\beta}\left[\ln\left(\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\beta\hbar\omega\right)\right)-\ln\left(1-\exp\left(-\beta\hbar\omega\right)\right)\right],\\
 & =-\frac{d}{d\beta}\left[-\frac{1}{2}\beta\hbar\omega-\ln\left(1-\exp\left(-\beta\hbar\omega\right)\right)\right],\\
 & =\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega+\frac{\hbar\omega\exp\left(-\beta\hbar\omega\right)}{1-\exp\left(-\beta\hbar\omega\right)},\\
 & =\hbar\omega\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\exp\left(\beta\hbar\omega\right)-1}\right),
\end{align*}

\end_inset

therefore 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{vib}=\hbar\omega\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\exp\left(\beta\hbar\omega\right)-1}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and the total contribution is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T+\hbar\omega\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\exp\left(\beta\hbar\omega\right)-1}\right),
\]

\end_inset

now, in the limit given 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{B}T\ll\hbar\omega\implies1\ll\beta\hbar\omega,
\]

\end_inset

the term with the exponential goes to infinity and the denominator goes
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, and the other factor is just a constant, thus we and up with the result
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U\approx\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T,
\]

\end_inset

which matches with the classical result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, in the case of high temperature, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T\gg\hbar\omega$
\end_inset

, and this implies that we can Taylor expand the term with the exponential
 as follows
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\exp\left(\beta\hbar\omega\right)-1}\approx\frac{1}{\beta\hbar\omega},
\]

\end_inset

thus
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
U & \approx\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T+\hbar\omega\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta\hbar\omega}\right),\\
 & \approx\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T+\frac{\hbar\omega}{2}+\frac{1}{\beta},
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and from this we can see that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U\approx\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T+k_{B}T,
\]

\end_inset

this is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U\approx\frac{5}{2}k_{B}T,
\]

\end_inset

which again, matches with the equipartition theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This result is in agreement with the analysis presented in the HW 1, in
 which we found the following: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the spacings between vibrational levels and between rotational levels about
 the molecular axis are much larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T$
\end_inset

, which implies that classical thermodynamics, including the equipartition
 theorem, do not apply
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And even more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

..for rotations about the two axes perpendicular to the molecular axis, however,
 the spacings between energy levels are much smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{B}T$
\end_inset

, so equipartition does apply.

 sorry for that.
 On the other hand I think the discussion of the partition function was
 quite good, and I didn't express the geometric series, I just used the
 solutions derived in class (well I also derived that myself), but I didn't
 want to make the solution any longer, probably not the best idea.

The molar concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere is currently

 separate and liquify the 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

 released annually in the US to the country’s annual electricity consumption.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
Let's start with the solution:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $421$
\end_inset

, which is around 
\begin_inset Formula $0.04\%$
\end_inset

 of the gases in the atmosphere, therefore if we assume that we can model
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

 as an ideal gas, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
pV=nRT,
\]

\end_inset

thus using the fact that the molar mass of the 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

 is also given by 
\begin_inset Formula $44.01$
\end_inset

 we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=n\frac{RT}{p}.
\]

\end_inset

But we need to convert the 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

 mass to moles, and for that we are going to use using its molar mass as
 follows: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{moles of }CO_{2}=\frac{\text{mass of }CO_{2}}{\text{molar mass of }CO_{2}\times\text{moles of }CO_{2}},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\text{moles of }CO_{2}=0.0226\text{ mol},
\]

\end_inset

on the other hand the molar mass of air, on average is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $28.97g/mol$
\end_inset

, and after plug those quantities in the ideal gas equation we have that
 the volume occupied by 1 kg of 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

 is given by approximately 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=86296.17\text{ L}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the change in entropy let's model this as an isobaric compression, and
 for this we know that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ΔS=nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{f}}{V_{i}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

thus, for the 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S_{CO_{2}}=nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{CO_{2}}}{V_{0}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and in the same way, for the air, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta S_{air}=nR\ln\left(\frac{V_{0}-V_{CO_{2}}}{V_{0}}\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For this process we're going to model it as an isothermal compression, thus
 we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=
\]

\end_inset

To calculate the work required to compress the separated CO2 isothermally
 to a pressure of 56 atm, we can use the formula for the work done during
 an isothermal compression of a gas:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=-\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}P\,dV,
\]

\end_inset

but because the compression is isothermal, the pressure and temperature
 remain constant, thus we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=-P\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}dV,
\]

\end_inset

but again, the compression is isothermal, we can use the ideal gas law to
 relate the initial and final volumes as follows 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p_{i}V_{i}=p_{f}V_{f}=\text{constant},
\]

\end_inset

and if assume that the initial pressure is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 atm, and the final is 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{f}=56$
\end_inset

 atm, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V_{i}=56V_{f},
\]

\end_inset

and from this we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=-P\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}}dV,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=55pV_{f},
\]

\end_inset

now using the fact that the work done per unit mass is equal to W divided
 by the mass of CO2, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W=\frac{55pV}{m_{CO_{2}}},
\]

\end_inset

and now, in order to find 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{f}$
\end_inset

 we can use the fact that at room temperature, the volume occupied by 1
 kg of liquid CO2 at 56 atm pressure would be the reciprocal of its density
 at that pressure.
 The density of liquid CO2 at 56 atm is approximately 0.881 kg/L, thus if
 we put the numbers, this will be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
W\approx3469.38\left[\frac{J}{kg}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The energy required to compress CO2 to a pressure of 56 atm, which is approximat
ely 3469.38 J/kg.
 And we're going to consider that the annual CO2 emissions in the US is
 around 
\begin_inset Formula $5×10^{12}$
\end_inset

 kg, and finally According to the U.S.
 Energy Information Administration (EIA), the annual electricity consumption
 in the US is around 3.5 to 4 trillion kilowatt-hours (kWh), and let's use
 former as an upper bound, thus we have that the total Energy for CO2 separation
 is equal to the energy required per kg times the total of CO2 emissions,
 and using the previous result we have that total energy for CO2 separation
 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
3469.38×\left(5×10^{12}\right)\left[\frac{Jkg}{kg}\right],
\]

\end_inset

thus the total energy of separation is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1.73469×10^{16}J,
\]

\end_inset

and on the other hand, the electricity consumption is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
4×10^{12}\left(3.6×10^{6}\right)\left[kWh\frac{J}{kWh}\right],
\]

\end_inset

which is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1.44\times10^{19}J,
\]

\end_inset

thus comparing the previous results we can see that the energy required
 to separate and liquefy the CO2 emitted annually in the US is smaller by
 three orders of magnitude compared to the country's annual electricity
 consumption.
 I think this suggest that it's worthwhile to think in the 
\begin_inset Formula $CO_{2}$
\end_inset

, I mean, it's still quite expensive, but small compared to the overall
 energy consumption of the nation.

\begin_layout Solution*
Let's begin:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
By definition 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is the angular frequency, and in order to not deal of factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

, let's work with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\omega=2\pi\nu,
\]

\end_inset

and with this 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\omega\right)$
\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(\nu\right)=\frac{A\left(2\pi\nu\right)^{3}}{\exp\left[\beta\hbar\left(2\pi\nu\right)\right]-1},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1/k_{B}T$
\end_inset

, and because 
\begin_inset Formula $\hbar=h/2\pi$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(\nu\right)=\frac{8\pi^{3}A\nu^{3}}{\exp\left[\beta h\nu\right]-1},
\]

\end_inset

now, going even further, let's make the following change of variables 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\beta h\omega,
\]

\end_inset

and with this we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(x\right)=\frac{8\pi^{3}A}{\beta^{3}\hbar^{3}}\left(\frac{x^{3}}{\exp\left(x\right)-1}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and let's rename 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A^{\prime}=\frac{8\pi^{3}A}{\beta^{3}\hbar^{3}},
\]

\end_inset

then it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(x\right)=A^{\prime}\left(\frac{x^{3}}{\exp\left(x\right)-1}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and from this we have the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{dP}{dx}=A^{\prime}\left(\frac{3x^{2}}{\exp\left(x\right)-1}-\frac{x^{3}\exp\left(x\right)}{\left(\exp\left(x\right)-1\right)^{2}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and in order to obtain the maximum we need to solve 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{3x^{2}}{\exp\left(x\right)-1}-\frac{x^{3}\exp\left(x\right)}{\left(\exp\left(x\right)-1\right)^{2}}=0\iff\frac{x^{2}}{\exp\left(x\right)-1}\left(3-\frac{x\exp\left(x\right)}{\exp\left(x\right)-1}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and from that we have two options, one is 
\begin_inset Formula $x=0$
\end_inset

, and the other one is given by the condition
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
3-\frac{x\exp\left(x\right)}{\exp\left(x\right)-1}=0\iff x=3\left(1-\exp\left(x\right)\right),
\]

\end_inset

but the previous equation is a transcendental equation, and in general is
 hard to find an analytical solution, or impossible in some cases.
 After plotting and exploring the behavior of the function and its derivative
 I decides to solve the equation it using Newton's method, and after my
 initial guess was 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{0}=2$
\end_inset

, let's me elaborate a little mote on the reason for that, but first, I'm
 going to present the plots of 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(\nu\right)$
\end_inset

 and its derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $dP/d\nu$

\begin_layout Solution*
As we can see, the maximum is located around 
\begin_inset Formula $x=3$
\end_inset

, but with the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $x<3$
\end_inset

, that's why I choose the initial guess 
\begin_inset Formula $x=2$
\end_inset

.
 Now, the numerical result is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{max}=2.82144,
\]

\end_inset

but we know that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=\beta h\nu,\hspace{1em}\beta=\frac{1}{k_{B}T},
\]

\end_inset

thus, we have that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{h\nu_{max}}{k_{B}T}=2.82144
\]

\end_inset

thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu_{max}=2.82144\frac{k_{B}T}{h}.
\]

\end_inset

Now if we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $T=5800$
\end_inset

 K, and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h=6.62607015\times10^{-34}\left[Js\right],k_{B}=1.380649\times10^{-23}\left[J/K\right]
\]

\end_inset

we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\nu_{max}=2.82144\left[\frac{\left(1.380649\times10^{-23}\right)\left(5800\right)}{6.62607015\times10^{-34}}\right]\left[\frac{\frac{J}{K}K}{Js}\right],
\]

\end_inset

and if we use 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c=\nu\lambda,
\]

\end_inset

we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{max}=\frac{c}{\nu_{max}},
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\lambda_{max}=8.76303\times10^{-7}\text{ m},
\]

\end_inset

and from that we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda_{max}=876.303\text{ nm}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Solution*
For b), yes my analysis shows a functional dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/T$
\end_inset

 in the peak, and this comes from the fact of making that change of variables
 which at the end, will give us the functional dependence showed in Wien's
 law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Solution*
c) Using the Wien's law with the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T=5800$
\end_inset

 K, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\lambda=\frac{2.898\times10^{-3}}{5800}\left[\frac{mK}{K}\right],
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\lambda=4.99655\times10^{-7}\text{ m}
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore\lambda=499.655\text{ nm},
\]

\end_inset

and as we can see the peak do not match.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Solution*
d) I have some thoughts on why the values of the peak do not coincide, one
 of them is because if we write the distribution in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 since the beginning, the functional form will be different, and that will
 move the peak, this is because of the relation between those variables,
 this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c=\lambda\nu\implies d\nu=-\frac{c}{\lambda^{2}}d\lambda,
\]

\end_inset

and the full distribution will be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(\lambda\right)=\frac{8\pi hc}{\lambda^{5}}\left(\frac{A}{\exp\left(\frac{\beta hc}{\lambda}\right)-1}\right),
\]

\end_inset

which as we can see have a different functional form.

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Solution*
Before doing any calculation I would like to write some definitions that
 are useful for the following discussion: let's suppose we have two systems
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}$
\end_inset

, each one with it's own thermodynamical parameters, if we put the system
 in thermal contact and let them exchange particles, after some time, we
 will reach equilibrium, assuming the connected system are closed.
 Thus the condition for diffusive equilibrium can be expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\mu_{0},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{0}$
\end_inset

 represents the chemical potential of the system at some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

point of reference
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Having said that, we know that particles flow from high chemical potential
 to lower chemical potential, in the same way as we observe heat flow, thus
 a difference in chemical potential acts in some sense as a driving force
 for the transfer or particles.
 And even more, we know that only differences in chemical potential have
 physical meaning, and we're also free to choose our 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zero
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 potential reference.
 Now, with this in mind, we know that when a potential is present, we can
 express the total chemical potential as the sum of the internal chemical
 potential and a the external chemical potential, and the former is defined
 as the potential energy per particle in the external potential, this is
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\mu_{tot}=\Delta\mu_{int}+\Delta\mu_{ext}.
\]

\end_inset

Now, in the following two problems I'm going to model the system as an ideal
 gas, I know this is not very accurate, in particular for the tree problem,
 but still, it'll give us a good feeling of the system, and for this reason
 I think it's important to write the chemical potential for an ideal gas,
 this is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu=k_{B}T\ln\left(n\lambda_{th}^{3}\right),
\]

\end_inset

but we also know that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n_{Q}^{-1/3}=\lambda_{th},
\]

\end_inset

thus, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu=k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n}{n_{Q}}\right).

, one must exert an inward force equal to the centripetal force at that
 radius, doing work on the particle, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-m\omega^{2}rdr,
\]

\end_inset

but, on the other hand, by definition we know that the chemical potential
 is the amount of energy we need in order to add one particle to the system,
 thus we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu=-m\omega^{2}\int rdr,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\mu=-\frac{m}{2}\omega^{2}r^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

Now, with this we have that the total chemical potential is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{tot}=k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n\left(r\right)}{n_{Q}}\right)-\frac{m}{2}\omega^{2}r^{2}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, if we imposing the condition of diffusive equilibrium, this is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{tot}=\mu_{0},
\]

\end_inset

and even more assuming an ideal gas, we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{tot}=k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n\left(r\right)}{n_{Q}}\right)-\frac{m}{2}\omega^{2}r^{2}=\mu_{0},
\]

\end_inset

and in this case we choose our reference potential such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{0}=k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n_{0}}{n_{Q}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{0}=n\left(0\right)$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n\left(r\right)}{n_{Q}}\right)-\frac{m}{2}\omega^{2}r^{2}=k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n_{0}}{n_{Q}}\right),
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\implies\ln\left(\frac{n\left(r\right)}{n_{Q}}\frac{n_{Q}}{n_{0}}\right)=\frac{m}{2k_{B}T}\omega^{2}r^{2},
\]

\end_inset

thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n\left(r\right)=n_{0}\exp\left(\frac{m\omega^{2}r^{2}}{2k_{B}T}\right)
\]

Tree:

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
As above, if we assume that the system is in diffusive equilibrium, and
 there are no external fields in the system, and even more, approximating
 the problem as an ideal gas, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\mu_{int}=k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n}{n_{Q}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $n=n_{0}r$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, with the previous result and assuming an external potential due to
 the gravitational field we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\mu_{ext}=mgh,
\]

\end_inset

and even more, assuming again, diffusive equilibrium 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mu_{tot}=\mu_{0},
\]

\end_inset

such that our reference point is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n_{0}}{n_{Q}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

then we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n}{n_{Q}}\right)+mgh=k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n_{0}}{n_{Q}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
mgh=-k_{B}T\ln\left(\frac{n}{n_{Q}}\frac{n_{Q}}{n_{0}}\right),
\]

\end_inset

and from this we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h=\frac{k_{B}T}{mg}\ln\left(\frac{n_{0}}{n}\right),
\]

\end_inset

but we know that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{n}{n_{0}}=r,
\]

\end_inset

thus 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h=\frac{k_{B}T}{mg}\ln\left(\frac{1}{r}\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, if we consider the humidity as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\left(r\right)/n_{0}=0.9$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $T=300$
\end_inset

 K, and the mass of water as 
\begin_inset Formula $m=18$
\end_inset

 g, then, then numerical value, after the corresponding conversions will
 be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h=1490.04\text{ m,}
\]

\end_inset

which is a really high number, consistent in some sense with the giant sequoias,
 but I not expect to have a good map with a real tree, because I'm not sure
 if the sap of a tree can be well modeled by an ideal, gas, I suspect that
 this is not the case, however, this give us some insight into the physical
 mechanism.

These problems were really challenging, my knowledge of the chemical potential
 was't good enough for this, so I had to read quite a lot on the books in
 my electronic library.

For the centrifuge I think our solutions are in agreement with each other,
 however I din't complete the part c.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\color red
For the tree sap, our solution is also in agreement, but I'm not very happy
 with the solution; as far as I know my whole solution rest on the fact
 that I'm thinking of an ideal gas, and this is not the case, however, I'm
 still not sure how to solve the problem using other assumptions but to
 ideal gas.
